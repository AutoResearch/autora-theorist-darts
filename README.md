## Developer Guide

### Get started

Clone the repository (e.g. using [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com), 
or the [`gh` command line tool](https://cli.github.com)) 
and install it in "editable" mode in an isolated `python` environment, (e.g. 
with 
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)) as follows:

In the repository root, create a new virtual environment:
```shell
virtualenv venv
```

Activate it:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Use `pip install` to install the current project (`"."`) in editable mode (`-e`) with dev-dependencies (`[dev]`):
```shell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the test cases:
```shell
pytest tests/ --doctest-modules src/
```

Activate the pre-commit hooks:
```shell
pre-commit install
```

### Add new dependencies 

In pyproject.toml add the new dependencies under `dependencies`

Install the added dependencies
```shell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Publish the package

Update the metadata under `project` in the pyproject.toml file to include name, description, author-name, author-email and version
